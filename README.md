OpenCraft
=========

Install
-------

Instructions based on Ubuntu 14.04.

If you're installing to your local Ubuntu 14.04:

```
$ make install_system_dependencies
```

Or if you would prefer to use Vagrant:

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for your OS
2. `$ vagrant up`
3. `$ vagrant ssh`

For either install method, continue with the following instructions:

Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper for Python3

```
$ make install_virtualenvwrapper_py3
$ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
$ source $HOME/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

Then reload `~/.bashrc`, create the virtual env and install the Python requirements:

```
$ . ~/.bashrc
$ mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 opencraft
$ workon opencraft
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Configure
---------

Create an `.env` file at the root of the repository or set environment variables, customizing the
settings from `opencraft/settings.py` which are loaded via `env()`. An example development .env is
already installed if you're using Vagrant.


Migrations
----------

To run database migrations:

```
$ make migrate
```

The startup commands such as `make run` and `make rundev` check for pending migrations, and will 
exit before starting the server if any are found. You can also check for pending migrations manually with:

```
$ make migration_check
```


Run
---

To run the development server:

```
$ make rundev
```

Then go to:

* User interface: [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
* API: [http://localhost:5000/api/](http://localhost:5000/api/)
* Admin: [http://localhost:5000/admin/](http://localhost:5000/admin/)

To run the production server:

```
$ make run
```

To change the number of concurrent workers ran by the production server:

```
$ make run WORKERS=2
```



Process description
-------------------

This runs three processus via honcho, which reads `Procfile` or `Procfile.dev` and loads the
environment from the `.env` file:

* *web*: the main HTTP server (Django - Werkzeug debugger in dev, gunicorn in prod)
* *websocket*: the websocket server (Tornado)
* *worker*: runs asynchronous jobs (Huey)

Important: the Werkzeug debugger started by the development server allows remote execution
of Python commands. It should *not* be run in production.


Static assets collection
------------------------

The Web server started in the development environment also doesn't require to run collectstatic
after each change.

The production environment automatically runs collectstatic on startup, but you can also run it
manually:

```
$ make collectstatic
```


Running the tests
-----------------

First, the current user can access postgresql and create databases, for the test database. Run:

```
$ sudo -u postgres createuser -d <currentunixuser>`
```

Where `<currentunixuser>` is replaced with the name of whatever user the app runs under. Then run 
the whole test suite (pylint, pyflakes, pep8, unit tests, etc.) with:

```
$ make test
```

To run a single test, use `make test_one`:

```
$ make test_one instance.tests.models.test_server
```

You can also run prospector and the unit tests independently:

```
$ make test_prospector
$ make test_unit
$ make test_integration
```

Note that the integration tests aren't run by default, as they require a working OpenStack cluster
configured. To run them, create a `.env.test` file - your development environment is likely a good
starting point:

```
$ ln -s .env .env.integration
```


Debug
-----

To access the console, you can use `shell_plus`:

```
$ make shell
```


Manage.py
---------

You can also access the Django `manage.py` command directly, using honcho to load the environment:

```
$ honcho run ./manage.py config
```
