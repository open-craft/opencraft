Hi,

Thank you very much for applying to participate to the OpenCraft.Hosting
betatest. Your instance is now ready:

{{ application.instance.url }}

The Studio interface used to create course materials is available at:

{{ application.instance.studio_url }}

To log in, use the email address {{ application.user.email }} and the password
you provided in the application.  You can reset your password by clicking the
"Forgot password?" link on the login page

{{ application.instance.url }}/login

It is a beta test, so there might occasionally be some issues, but your
instance should be usable in a production setting - a lot of the current
betatesters already do. If you notice any issue, let me know! That's where we
need your help, to know what needs fixing : )
