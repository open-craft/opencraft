# Views - API #################################################################


class InstanceViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    """
    API to list and manipulate instances.

    Uses InstanceReference to iterate all types of instances, and serializes them.

    The fields that are returned for each instance depend on its instance_type and whether you
    are listing all instances (returns fewer fields) or just one instance (returns all fields).

    The only fields that are available for all instances, regardless of type, are the fields
    defined on the InstanceReference class, namely:

    * `id`
    * `name`
    * `notes`
    * `created`
    * `modified`
    * `instance_type`
    * `is_archived`

    Note that IDs used for instances are always the ID of the InstanceReference object, which
    may not be the same as the ID of the specific Instance subclass (e.g. the OpenEdXInstance
    object has its own ID which should never be used - just use its InstanceReference ID). This
    detail is managed by the API so users of the API should not generally need to be aware of
    it.
