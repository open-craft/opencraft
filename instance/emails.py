    Decorator around spawn_appserver that catches all the emited exceptions and notifies by email
    when it detects that a server deployment failed because of infrastructure problems.
    It doesn't change spawn_server's behaviour (it will still raise exceptions on error).
    It is done as a decorator to separate the e-mail code from the server-spawning code.

    Different instances might have different e-mail requirements. E.g. an instance that builds the 'master'
    branch of edx/edx-platform will send an e-mail to edX devops in case of failure.
    In a future version, we could detect the 'owner' of the instance (e.g. the person who created the PR) and notify
    them by e-mail when a deployment finished with or without error.
