Configuration
-------------

[Honcho](https://honcho.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will set up environment
variables defined in the `.env` file at the root of your repository. If you are
using vagrant for development, a basic `.env` file will already have been
created for you, but you will need to add credentials for third-party services
manually in order to run the development server or the integration tests.

The environment variables in `.env` customize the settings from
`opencraft/settings.py` which are loaded via `env()`. For more information about
each setting, see the [list of settings](#application-settings) below, and
[`opencraft/settings.py`](https://github.com/open-craft/opencraft/tree/master/opencraft/settings.py).
As a minimum, you will need to add credentials for OpenStack, Gandi, RabbitMQ, and GitHub.
You can use this example `.env` file as a starting point:

```sh
SECRET_KEY='...'
DATABASE_URL='postgres://localhost/opencraft'
OPENSTACK_USER='username'
OPENSTACK_PASSWORD='password'
OPENSTACK_TENANT='tenant-name'
OPENSTACK_AUTH_URL='https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/v2.0'
OPENSTACK_REGION='BHS1'
OPENSTACK_SANDBOX_SSH_KEYNAME='keypair-name'
DEFAULT_INSTANCE_BASE_DOMAIN='example.com'
GANDI_API_KEY='api-key'
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN='github-token'
```

You can also configure the environment variables using a YAML file from which
Ansible can load these values. Create a file called ``private.yml`` and use the
following contents as a starting point:

```yaml
OPENCRAFT_ENV_TOKENS:
  SECRET_KEY: '...'
  DATABASE_URL: 'postgres://localhost/opencraft'
  OPENSTACK_USER: 'username'
  OPENSTACK_PASSWORD: 'password'
  OPENSTACK_TENANT: 'tenant-name'
  OPENSTACK_AUTH_URL: 'https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/v2.0'
  OPENSTACK_REGION: 'BHS1'
  OPENSTACK_SANDBOX_SSH_KEYNAME: 'keypair-name'
  DEFAULT_INSTANCE_BASE_DOMAIN: 'example.com'
  GANDI_API_KEY: 'api-key'
  GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN: 'github-token'
```

### A note on SSH keys

The instance manager uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to provision
openedx sandboxes. Ansible uses SSH to run commands on remote servers, so you
will need to configure the instance manager with an SSH key pair to use for this
purpose.

First, **as the user that the instance manager runs as (e.g. `vagrant`)**, run:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

This will create an ssh key pair for that user, saving it at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and
`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` by default. Next, we need to upload the public key to
OpenStack. Make sure the nova command line client is installed (it should already
be the case from the OpenCraft IM python environment):

    pip install python-openstackclient

[Configure the client](https://web.archive.org/web/20161105104308/https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-set-environment-variables-using-openstack-rc.html),
with the same OpenStack credentials that you used in the `.env` file and run:

    openstack keypair create --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub KEY_NAME

where `KEY_NAME` is the name used to identify this key pair in OpenStack. The
`OPENSTACK_SANDBOX_SSH_KEYNAME` setting in your `.env` file should be set to
this name.

### OpenStack images

Open edX is currently designed to run on Ubuntu 16.04. Your OpenStack host may
already have an image available for this version of Ubuntu. You can manage
OpenStack images using `glance`:

    pip install python-glanceclient

You can check the images available with your host using:

    glance image-list

For maximum compatibility we recommend the
[official Ubuntu cloud image](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/xenial/current/).
If this image is not available with your host, you can fetch it and add to
OpenStack using `glance`:

    wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/xenial/current/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img
    glance image-create \
      --disk-format=qcow2 \
      --container-format=bare \
      --file xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img \
      --name IMAGE_NAME \
      --progress

where `IMAGE_NAME` is the name used to identify the image in OpenStack. The
`OPENSTACK_SANDBOX_BASE_IMAGE` setting in your `.env` file should match this
name:

    OPENSTACK_SANDBOX_BASE_IMAGE='{"name": "IMAGE_NAME"}'

### OpenStack flavors

OpenStack instances come in various
[flavors](http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/flavors.html),
roughly equivalent to EC2 instance sizes. You must specify a flavor to use for
sandboxes. To see a list of available flavors, run:

    nova flavor-list

Set the `OPENSTACK_SANDBOX_FLAVOR` setting in your `.env` file to your chosen
flavor:

    OPENSTACK_SANDBOX_FLAVOR='{"name": "m1.medium"}'

### OpenStack Security Groups

Every VM used to host Open edX will automatically be added to an OpenStack
network security group, which provides a firewall that limits what
ports/services on the VM are exposed to the Internet. The security group will
automatically be created and managed by OpenCraft IM.

Instances of Open edX can also be assigned additional security groups.
Typically, these additional security groups would not contain any rules; they
are instead used for things like granting access to a specific database server.
(e.g. add an additional security group called `allow-mysql-access` to the Open
edX instance; it does not need to contain any rules. Then, on your MySQL server,
edit its security group rules to only allow access to VMs in the
`allow-mysql-access` security group.)

  Ansible scripts to use. Defaults to
  `https://github.com/edx/configuration.git`.
* `DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION_VERSION`: The branch/tag/commit from the configuration

* `OPENEDX_APPSERVER_SECURITY_GROUP_RULES`: This specifies the firewall rules
  that the above security group will have. The default allows ingress on ports
  22, 80, and 443 only.
* `EDX_WORKERS_ENABLE_CELERY_HEARTBEATS`: Switch to enable/disable celery
  heartbeats used to detect connection drops. Disabling heartbeats can have a

Databases
---------

You must configure external databases that can be used by any app server belonging
to an instance, following these steps:

1. Set up external MySQL and MongoDB databases, making a note of hostname
   and authentication information (username, password) for each one of them.

2. In your `.env` file, set `DEFAULT_INSTANCE_MYSQL_URL` and `DEFAULT_INSTANCE_MONGO_URL`
   to URLs that point to the MySQL and MongoDB servers created in the previous step:


        DEFAULT_INSTANCE_MYSQL_URL='mysql://<user>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>'
        DEFAULT_INSTANCE_MONGO_URL='mongodb://<user>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>'


   Note that:

   * `<user>` must have necessary permissions to create databases and users,
     and to grant privileges on the MySQL/MongoDB server.

   * `<hostname>` can be an IP address.

   * `<port>` is optional. It defaults to `3306` for MySQL databases,
     and to `27017` for MongoDB databases.

   The next time you create an instance, the instance manager will automatically
   create a `MySQLServer` and a `MongoDBServer` using the values of the
   `DEFAULT_INSTANCE_MYSQL_URL` and `DEFAULT_INSTANCE_MONGO_URL` settings
   and assign it to the instance.

   **Alternatively**, you can skip setting `DEFAULT_INSTANCE_MYSQL_URL` and `DEFAULT_INSTANCE_MONGO_URL`
   and create `MySQLServer` and `MongoDBServer` objects yourself via the shell or via the Django admin.

```python
from instance.models.database_server import MySQLServer, MongoDBServer

MySQLServer.objects.create(
    hostname='<hostname>',
    user='<username>',
    password='<password>',
    port=<port>,
)

MongoDBServer.objects.create(
    hostname='<hostname>',
    user='<username>',
    password='<password>',
    port=<port>,
)
```

   You can create as many `MySQLServer` and `MongoDBServer` objects as you like.
   If there are multiple servers of a given type to choose from, the instance manager
   will randomly select and assign one of them when you create a new instance.

When the instance manager provisions an app server for an instance that uses persistent databases,
it will automatically add the necessary settings on the associated external database server
to enable the app server to read and store application data. It will also add any information
that is necessary for connecting to the database server to the app server configuration.

Each instance controls its own set of databases on the external database servers,
so it is fine for multiple instances to use the same MySQL and MongoDB database servers.
Set up multiple database servers if the instance manager controls a large number of instances,
or if individual instances receive a large amount of traffic.
