    Automatically deploy a new server with the latest version of Open edX.
    It uses the master branch from https://github.com/edx/edx-platform, https://github.com/edx/configuration and
    downloads all dependencies specified in the requirements files.
    It acts as a "continuous integration" system that uses Ocim's servers, including OVH and OpenStack, instead of
    the other technologies used in edX's CI system.
    The built version doesn't depend on any PRs (see WatchedFork and pr_watch for that).
    Because a deployment can take up to 2 hours, don't run this task more often than that, or else you'll have appserver overflow.
