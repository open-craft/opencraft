Hi!

Seems like your DNS entries needed to connect your domain are not properly configured.
Log in to your domain provider to manage these settings. Configure the following entries:

1. Name: {{external_domain}}
   Type: CNAME
   Value: {{cname_value}}

2. Name: *.{{external_domain}}
   Type: CNAME
   Value: {{cname_value}}


And if you need anything, or have any questions or remarks, don't hesitate to reply to this
email.
